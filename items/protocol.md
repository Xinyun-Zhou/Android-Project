# Conflict Resolution Protocol

## Protocol 1
### Situation
A member fails to meet the initial plan and/or deadlines

### General Ideas for Conflict Resolution
- Keep in track for every group members process

- Determine what still needs to be done and how it will affect future deadlines

- If other members are finished with their tasks, allocate some work to help out

- Analyse the amount of work allocated and how much got done - for planning deadlines in the future 

- Blockers should be raised early and with open and honest communication

- All members should strive to keep their team informed of their situation, how are they progressing and where they require support

### Course of Action
#### 1. Confirm the situation:

- **Special circumstances:**
    - Possible absence time
    - Which part completed
    - Which part incomplete

- **Assigned task spend longer time than expected:**
    - extension time
    - which part
    - why the task is necessary

#### 2. Solution: 
Discuss the in the group and find whether the unfinished task is necessary

- **If the task is necessary:** 
    - reassign the task
    - whether there is a substitute

- **If the task is unnecessary:**
    - If the other parts of the project need to change
    - Whether need to re assign the task



## Protocol 2
### Situation
The group has issues

### General Ideas for Conflict Resolution
- Call a group meeting to discuss

- Listen and document and document all opinions. Aim to reach a consensus with compromise if necessary to ensure the project has a good outcome

- Inform the team as soon as possible, via email or teams channel then plan a formal meeting to discuss the issue

### Course of Action
Have a group meeting, record or take notes for the whole meeting:

1. What’s the issue
2. Reason for this issue
3. A’s perspective
4. B’s perspective
5. …
6. A’s solution
7. B’s solution
8. …
9. If we can find a mutually satisfactory result
10. If not, should we discuss with tutor and B

## Protocol 3
### Situation
A member gets sick

### General Ideas for Conflict Resolution
- Let the team know as soon as possible that you are going down sick

- If possible, provide a handover to the team, detailing where you were up to, what was left to do, any blockers, then the team may re-allocate work based on priority 

### Course of Action
Determine how urgent the work is and how it will affect the deadlines. If urgent, remaining members split some of the work between them. 

It is expected that at least one member will run into issues that prevent them from doing work during the course of this project. To mitigate this we could reduce how dependent each member’s tasks are on other members’ code. We should also expect that in many situations some members will have to do more work than others.

Given the similarity between this situation and the one in Protocol 1, reference can be made to the latter when resolving the conflict.
